The lack of space between page content and tune-in varies, depending on the tune-in format, day of the week the show airs, and the calendar date.  Examples of issue and its variations:  - Issue currently occurs for some shows airing on Tuesdays (Scream Queens, Grandfathered); when calendar date goes to single digit the week after next, the issue will be lessened. - There is slightly more space between tune-in and page content on Sundays and Mondays, since the names of those days are shorter than Tuesday. - Issue is not occurring on Wednesdays; since Wednesday is a much longer word, the tune-in wraps earlier. - Unclear whether issue will occur on Thursdays.  Currently there is space between the tune-in date and page content; when date goes to double digit, it is unknown if it will wrap or abut page content. - For shows that air on the half hour (Grinder, LMOE) it is not an issue since the longer air time results in the tune-in wrapping before the date. - Issue is not currently occurring on photo gallery or bio detail pages due to missing tune-in (FOXRDM-3335). - Issue is not occurring on shows that are using unique tune-in formats (e.g., Bob's Burgers, Brooklyn 9-9)  The tune-in issue is occurring in all Chrome and IE on desktop; it is not occurring in Firefox, where the tune-in wraps differently.  It is also occurring in Safari on tablet in landscape.",NULL
